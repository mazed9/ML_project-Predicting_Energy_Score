# ML_project-Predicting_Energy_Score
In this ML project, I worked with a real-world dataset. This task was assigned to me by my thesis supervisor. The task is to:

### Use the provided building energy data to develop a model that can predict a building's Energy Star score, and then interpret the results to find the variables that are most predictive of the score.

In this project, I carried out all the steps of a machine-learning problem:

1. Cleaned the data

2. Performed exploratory data analysis

3. Performed Feature engineering

4. Compared several machine learning models on a performance metric

5. Performed hyperparameter tuning on the best model to optimize it for the problem

6. Evaluated the best model on the testing set
